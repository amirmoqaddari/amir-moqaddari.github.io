            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> My name is Amir Hossain Moqaddari and I am a passionate medicinal chemist based in Iran. Ever since I was young, I have been fascinated by the role that chemistry plays in improving human health and well-being. This inspired me to pursue my education in related fields.

I hold a BSc in Polymer Engineering from the University of Tehran, where I developed a strong foundation in organic chemistry. However, it was during my undergraduate research projects that my interest in medicinal applications truly took off. I delved deeper into topics at the intersection of chemistry and medicine, leading me to choose a focus on drug delivery for my final year project.

This experience convinced me to specialize in medicinal chemistry for my postgraduate studies. I am currently completing an MS in Medicinal Chemistry from Shahid Beheshti University. My thesis work involves drug design and synthesis, leveraging both wet lab skills and computational techniques. In particular, I am optimizing the industrial production of celecoxib and designing novel derivatives of the anticancer alkaloid noscapine.

Beyond my formal education, I have gained valuable hands-on experience through internships and research roles. This includes molecular modeling projects exploring potential treatments for neurological disorders and tropical diseases like leishmaniasis. I also enjoy teaching and mentoring younger students, having served as a teaching assistant for computational drug design courses.

Looking ahead, I aspire to pursue a PhD with a focus on drug discovery research. My ultimate goal is to directly contribute to advancing human health through breakthrough medicines. When not in the lab, I enjoy learning new languages and cultures. I also like to stay active through sports and outdoor activities.

I am constantly working to expand my knowledge and skillset within the exciting field of medicinal chemistry. Please feel free to contact me if you think we could collaborate on innovative research. I would be happy to discuss my qualifications and experience further.  </p>
